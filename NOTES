needed to add a check for system awake as an initializer
added a check for timer validation to make sure we werent making a new instantiation of a timer again and again
changed the implementation of the timerAccumulator to be INT rather than DOUBLE

This is practice program with Timers, specifically on the Apple Watch.

This is determined to be a simulator issue. 

the basics of the timer and the displayed clock appear to be working in this version. I thought that the Timer paused when the screen locks but in this version it did not . Not 100% sure why. Usable as a baseline for more advanced code.
